:description: Deploy a Hazelcast Kubernetes cluster and connect to it, using a client outside Kubernetes.

NOTE: This guide uses Helm and Kubectl for deploying the Hazelcast cluster. If you want to use the Hazelcast Platform Operator instead, see xref:hazelcast-platform-operator-expose-externally.adoc[].

== What You’ll Learn

{description}

== Before you Begin

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Minikube] is good enough)
* Kubernetes command line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl]

== Introduction

There are two approaches you may want to use when setting up on-premises Hazelcast cluster in Kubernetes:

* **Unisocket Client** - client sends requests to a random Hazelcast member
* **Smart Client** - client connects to all members and sends requests directly to the members owning the data

Let's see both approaches.

== Unisocket Client

The simplest possible scenario is to deploy the Hazelcast cluster on Kubernetes and expose all Hazelcast pods with one `LoadBalancer` (or `NodePort`) service. With that approach, we piggyback on the standard Kubernetes mechanism, which automatically load balances the traffic to Hazelcast members.

=== Starting Hazelcast cluster

There are different ways of deploying Hazelcast to Kubernetes. For the production environment we recommend using Helm.

[tabs]
====

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml

kubectl run hz-hazelcast-0 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-1 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-2 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"

kubectl create service loadbalancer hz-hazelcast --tcp=5701 -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl set selector --local -f - "role=hazelcast" -o yaml | kubectl create -f -
----
--

Helm::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install hz-hazelcast --set service.type=LoadBalancer hazelcast/hazelcast
----
--

====

=== Verifying Hazelcast cluster

You can check that the Hazelcast cluster is up and running.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hz-hazelcast-0   1/1     Running   0          32s
hz-hazelcast-1   1/1     Running   0          30s
hz-hazelcast-2   1/1     Running   0          29s
----

You can also check that all Hazelcast members formed a cluster.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs hz-hazelcast-0
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.216.6.7]:5701 - 6d2100e0-8dcf-4e7c-ab40-8e98e23475e3 this
        Member [10.216.5.6]:5701 - 5ab4d554-fd7d-4929-8475-0ddf79a21076
        Member [10.216.8.6]:5701 - 7f7dd5f4-e732-4575-89d6-a6e823da38da
]
----

At this point you have a Hazelcast cluster exposed with a single LoadBalancer service called `hz-hazelcast`. You can find it's address with the following command.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get service hz-hazelcast
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)          AGE
hz-hazelcast   LoadBalancer   10.108.141.178   10.96.184.178     5701:31434/TCP   5m44s
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Minikube, you need to execute `minikube tunnel` now in order to get LoadBalancer External IPs assigned.
====

The field `EXTERNAL-IP` is the address of your Hazelcast cluster.

=== Connecting with Hazelcast Client

Configure the Hazelcast client with the external address and disable smart routing to use the unisocket connection.

import hazelcast

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    cluster_members=["<EXTERNAL-IP>"],
    use_public_ip=True,
    smart_routing=False,

                            .set_smart_routing(false);

=== Clean Up

To clean up the environment execute the following commands.

[tabs]
====

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete pod/hz-hazelcast-0 pod/hz-hazelcast-1 pod/hz-hazelcast-2 service/hz-hazelcast
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml
----
--

Helm::

--
[source, bash]
----
helm uninstall hz-hazelcast
----
--
====

Unisocket is very simple to configure; however, it has one significant drawback - low performance. Using a load balancer is perfect for traffic distribution across stateless services; however, Hazelcast is not stateless. Actually, Hazelcast is more like a sharded database in which each member contains a different part of the data. That is why it’s suboptimal to randomly load balance the traffic. It effectively means that each operation needs to be internally migrated, because your data may be load balanced to member 1, while the partition for its key is stored in member 2. All in all, if performance is important for your use case, then you need to use smart client.

== Smart Client

Hazelcast smart client is capable of mapping the given key with its owner member, which means that it sends the data directly to the member which contains the right data partition. This fact implies that in the Kubernetes environment, we need to provide access to each Hazelcast pod from the outside. A dynamic approach to this problem is to expose each pod with a separate service. Again, the service can be either `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`. In a real-life scenario, that would probably be `NodePort`, since having a separate public IP for each pod is expensive.

.Hazelcast Smart Client
image::smart.jpg[Hazelcast Smart Client]

Kubernetes does not offer a feature for automatically creating a service for each pod. That is why to set up a cluster this way we need to either expose each pod manually with `kubectl` or use Helm by enabling `externalAccess` feature.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Minikube, you need to execute `minikube tunnel` now in order to get LoadBalancer External IPs assigned.

To create a `loadbalancer` for each running Hazelcast pod you need to run the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml

kubectl create service loadbalancer hz-hazelcast-0 --tcp=5701
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-0 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION --port=5701 -l "app=hz-hazelcast-0,role=hazelcast"
kubectl create service loadbalancer hz-hazelcast-1 --tcp=5701
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-1 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION --port=5701 -l "app=hz-hazelcast-1,role=hazelcast"
kubectl create service loadbalancer hz-hazelcast-2 --tcp=5701
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-2 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION --port=5701 -l "app=hz-hazelcast-2,role=hazelcast"

kubectl create service loadbalancer hz-hazelcast --tcp=5701 -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl set selector --local -f - "role=hazelcast" -o yaml | kubectl create -f -
----
--

Helm::
+
--

To start the Hazelcast cluster with external access feature enabled, you need to make the following configuration in the `values.yaml` file:

[source, yaml]
.values.yaml
----
include::example$kubernetes-external-client/values.yaml[]
----

[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install hz-hazelcast -f service-per-pod/values.yaml hazelcast/hazelcast
----
--
====

[NOTE]
====
Note that each service created per pod must start before the Hazelcast pod itself. Otherwise Hazelcast won't be able to resolve its public addresses. We are achieving this by running init containers to ensure each member's matching service has its external address.
====

=== Verifying Hazelcast cluster

You can check that the Hazelcast cluster is up and running.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hz-hazelcast-0   1/1     Running   0          32s
hz-hazelcast-1   1/1     Running   0          30s
hz-hazelcast-2   1/1     Running   0          29s
----

At this point, you should also have every Hazelcast member exposed with a separate externally accessible address.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get service
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
hz-hazelcast     LoadBalancer   10.219.246.40    35.230.84.127    5701:30443/TCP   4m2s
hz-hazelcast-0   LoadBalancer   10.219.255.141   34.145.108.167   5701:30091/TCP   4m7s
hz-hazelcast-1   LoadBalancer   10.219.241.203   34.82.71.106     5701:30687/TCP   4m5s
hz-hazelcast-2   LoadBalancer   10.219.247.106   35.247.93.190    5701:32452/TCP   4m4s
----

We'll use the `hz-hazelcast` service for the discovery.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get service hz-hazelcast
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
hz-hazelcast   LoadBalancer   10.219.246.40   35.230.84.127   5701:30443/TCP   5m29s
----
